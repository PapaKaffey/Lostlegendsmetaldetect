# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

To deploy your project using GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Your Repository is Public**: GitHub Pages works only with public repositories unless you are using a custom domain.

2. **Go to Repository Settings**: In your repository, navigate to the `Settings` tab.

3. **Locate the GitHub Pages Section**: Scroll down to the `GitHub Pages` section.

4. **Select the Source**: From the `Source` dropdown menu, choose the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages. Commonly, this is the `main` or `gh-pages` branch. 

5. **Select a Folder (Optional)**: You can choose to publish the root folder or a specific folder like `/docs`.

6. **Save**: Make sure to click the `Save` button after selecting your source.

7. **Access Your Site**: At the top of the GitHub Pages section, you'll see a link to your deployed site. It usually follows the format: `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO-NAME>/`.

8. **Deploy Updates**: Any committed changes to the selected branch will be updated automatically on the GitHub Pages site. 

9. **Custom Domain (Optional)**: If you wish to use a custom domain, follow the additional instructions provided in the `GitHub Pages` section.

10. **Troubleshooting**: If your site does not appear, check to ensure your repository is public and that the correct branch and folder are selected in the settings.
